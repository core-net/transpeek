How it works - part GPS Activity, Arduino, HC-05 Bluetooth module (more info check refferal):
1. Implement Arduino Uno and HC-05 Bluetooth module
2. Connect your Arduino to the laptop
3. Upload your program to Arduino then open the Serial Monitor on your Arduino IDE
4. Connect your Android device and HC-05 Bluetooth module via bluetooth paring. 5. Once it is paired, the HC-05 Bluetooth module LED will be blinking once per second
6. Once it's connected, run your GPS Activity
7. Check GPS sensor at ON and TX checked box
8. Connect your GPS Activity to HC-05 Bluetooth module via bluetooth. Once it is paired, the HC-05 Bluetooth module LED will be blinking twice per second
9. Check the output on Serial Monitor, when it shows you your current GPS 
10. Location from your Android device, then it works 9.Split the latitude and longitude that you retrieve then store it to your database

How it works - part Router:
1. By default, the router do nothing, to make it run a function that store the database to the internet, we have to add code in /sistem/etc/rc.local
2. Code in that file is used to open /sistem/root/test.sh whenever the router works
3. In test.sh file, there are line of codes that is used to loop every single line in apps.transpeek.com and run it through terminal-browser (using wget function), then the locations (latitude and longitude) will be store to /dev/ttyACM0.
